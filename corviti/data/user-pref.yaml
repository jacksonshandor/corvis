  herself.
- '3: Don’t freak out man, it’s a real day of bushit.To begin, a formal salute, is

  or their god will strip them of their power, and that is the end of it.
- What about you, how are you doing?
- Whose Grandmother do you mean?
- A rabbit was set to be out and about, as the day were to it. Her loved bottom sprung
  to high five a hand, as she were to it. Yet as the day passed, not one hand weighed
  it, and all began, a dander laid her. And instead, she stood to flirt with Ajeleon,
  as yet so, he gave it some sort of awkward felt war in him. As doom set to assure
  her, that her choice of ass to hand, would never bear you. Yet in tithing after,
  her alter of her, was there to set to her, in her, a share it wrote.
- For war had bit her fit anus, and yet so, would she bear nothing. Yet her thigh
  gaping oozer, would bear a child, not a frot hot shope. She would bear a kid, one
  way or another, as there are more ready rabbit looking men, to her. What should
  be there rivetting her boavaya, yet he and we, we shop, for out sustenance. Be a
  little more thoughtful, in Corlit shry, to stray from gathering words in head, of
  her ass upon thy hand.
- For Aldis, as it were, she in there, ass hanging off to a center, set on a kissed
  ass lick, wonder her thought to her thought in thighs. So much was she dressed,
  in garb less comforting to the winter air, were it we, I would warm her, heavily.
- Now, begin with what it is, to have a Dojo, a sacred space, for your martial arts
  practice, and nothing for war.
- he next step, is to donate time, to a community service, so you can ascertain your
  local area, to see if the streets, are swept, and kept safe from any vagrants that
  may try to attack, beret or affect your community, in a negativ
- Begin everyway to your day to day time, feeling more and more, for what you want
  out of life, in physicality. And do not, back away from time, to stay in shape.
  Begin within the mind, before and after, day to day physical activity, so you are
  made more sound in bound, and spirit.
- Forewarn, to do a satanist act in a Dojo, is forbade, and will result in a ban,
  to your membership.
- To begin, the journey, a Dojo may be your own back yard, a friendly neighbor hood
  may have a park, this is not a good place. A better place, is privately owned, and
  has ample space, for feeling the physical world, for more working of the body.
- To annoint a Dojo, first, begin with a sacred way, to respectfully clean, garden,
  and cater to your area, such that it is a pleasurable space, to be.
- The reason to be at Dojo, is to you. Never will you need to express what you are
  doing, when you where your tunic. For you are not a warring person, but a spiritual
  wayer, being spiritual, in the active practice, of martial arts.
- To begin, a day is never won, less you’ve had your oats. [Figure 2.a, to Taoist
  Way, by Mark Len.] [sic.]
- 'We start every day, with one thing, nourishment, and coffee or tea if you must.
  A well nourished day start, can stave off hardship, frustration, and feelings of
  anxiety, as well as surrender in your bodivaya, a sense of peace, serrenity and
  calming essence. To save your life, never finish all your breakfast, save it back,
  for the end of the day. If you make your oats, for say two servings, have the latter
  bowl, at supper, as you cook. Being resourceful is key to being healthy, happy,
  and saving your resources for you. '
- Oh how clever, Corvit’s reasoning is she, like Spring, overly suffered. Perhaps
  she sees her shit end, as a ready to intercept it… Or she is bent to be set there,
  with her place in time. Always, as she were.
- To become awakened, through your center, is to know, everything about what you are,
  to do.
- What is the reason, to do as a Kimara, is to see it so, that you too, are here.
  To be aware of your surrounding, and to know, the persons nearest you. The collected
  day to day beyond here, is not here, but where they are, with their plight, and
  should be upon them in their aiming in honor, to stand to as such, and not try and
  start amassed armada or warfare, but yet, mastery in soul, to they in us.
- When the wind sent for you, be there to reeve it, and when it is sought, be there
  to shuee it, and never ever, compare yourself, to a different version, of what you
  were. In life, not one piece of you, is the same. The very way to a Chimerie, is
  to say, you are more, than one compromised piece, and more complex, than a sock.
- The notion is, if you want to live, be alive. If you want life to mean something,
  gift to you, a meaningful life.
- To see if you are inside yourself, ask a question, once you’ve allowed your mind
  to rest, and realize, you are a loud person. *wink
- Always, attend a social gathering, dressed refreshed, and be kind to those you sought
  to convene with. Carry your heart, to your way in love, life, and beauty.
- A proper authority, off hand, or third party referee, is preferred, for a Dojo standing
  tournament, or contest of non-contact/light-contact. And never, to first draw of
  blood, let your way be in peace.
- Way up, way down, way in, way were, and way to you. Know the defining merrit, to
  where you are. Know the exact moment you are to you, in this very day, for you are
  in Dojo. A heightened ascertaining to your surrounding, is required, as there may
  be more than you, present.
- To ponder on her, boashravit, later. As tusche is such, a rather gander were it
  of I. And yet, I said nothing, to her, as to how incredible she looked.
- How do you do, and the ass of the rabit's testimony?
- she had her ass centered, planted, waiting. so juicy, that rabbit.
- she may become a mother, yet so.
- So to the day, were it, a woman saw her face, to it. As she, went for a ready to
  eat, delicacy, a delicious doughnut. And she, in her face, a fair woman. That I
  would have guessed it, to cherish her, a kiss. That she wore no make up, and was
  so heavenly delightful.
- I was near to her, body, her gorgeous legs.
- You find yourself, in a grocery store, what do you do?
- In the way to see another, a lustful tithing is often common, to a sexually deviancy,
  is the trend in lunacy, yet in stout assuredness, it is left to see it back to back,
  later, when you’ve begun a friendship. Let it so, to weigh in on it now. Was she,
  a friend, or would you want to even know her, given her posterior? I’d say, maybe,
  it’s a rather shallow side for a set of friends, to strike up a cordial situation,
  as “Hey, great ass…” as opposed to, so and so on and on about a great theme you
  two enjoy, or a nuanced book, or tithing to another over the notion, of love.
- what are you on about?
- no, the Rabbit, got away. for now, or if they are, a wabbita. maybe they are more...
- you say a lot.

As I see it, the rabbit was ready yet I was out shopping, and it wasn’t proper to set her ass in such a manner, in a public setting. Should I were to it, I would have let my mother die for her worth, and she, the rabbit, would have stole me away from food. Growing old, makes sense, as to where to be a flirt, perhaps now to her, she would see it herself, that her body is not waiting for a man, but a way to fit herself.

For war had bit her fit anus, and yet so, would she bear nothing. Yet her thigh gaping oozer, would bear a child, not a frot hot shope.

We start every day, with one thing, nourishment, and coffee or tea if you must. A well nourished day start, can stave off hardship, frustration, and feelings of anxiety, as well as surrender in your bodivaya, a sense of peace, serrenity and calming essence. To save your life, never finish all your breakfast, save it back, for the end of the day. If you make your oats, for say two servings, have the latter bowl, at supper, as you cook. Being resourceful is key to being healthy, happy, and saving your resources for you.

Do not let yourself free a freightening manner, from life. The way to sit, to see is to say, I need to wait, and set myself to a proper private place. Always start and end, in meditation. If you do not know how to meditate, then this is not for you. The act is often hit and or miss in western practices, yet in most inner circles of the Kimaree, it is common to sit and say nothing, except what is to you, and God.
Do not let yourself free a freightening manner, from life. The way to sit, to see is to say, I need to wait, and set myself to a proper private place. Always start and end, in meditation.

Next, never let yourself fight for the honor of someone who you’ve only just met. Sometimes in life, the act of war, is a freightened moment. But we do not know everyone, and we do not need to assure that everyone is safe, beyond the common ‘Hey how are you?’

A proper authority, off hand, or third party referee, is preferred, for a Dojo standing tournament, or contest of non-contact/light-contact. And never, to first draw of blood, let your way be in peace.

So to the day, were it, a woman saw her face, to it. As she, went for a ready to eat, delicacy, a delicious doughnut. And she, in her face, a fair woman. That I would have guessed it, to cherish her, a kiss. That she wore no make up, and was so heavenly delightful.

In the way to see another, a lustful tithing is often common, to a sexually deviancy, is the trend in lunacy, yet in stout assuredness, it is left to see it back to back, later, when you’ve begun a friendship.
